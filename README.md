This analysis will explore and look at a few factors that potentially influence in-game win rates (positively/negatively).
Especifically, the following factors will be focused upon:<br />

1. __Deer pushed (and if so, the no. of deer pushed)__
	+ For non-aoe2 nerds, at the start of each game (called Dark Age), both players have access to a scout through which their respective maps can be explored- this 
	includes scouting their own resources (gold mines, etc) along with opponent base. Luring deer can be cumbersome and time consuming due to pathing (also dependent on overall skill level of a given player), additional 'free' food gathered from luring deer then becomes a trade off between early 
and robust scouting (when not luring deer) versus potentially late/weak scouting of enemy map and position on the map.
2. __Eapm__
	+ Effective Actions Per Minute include a sequence of moves, unlike spam clicking, whereby actions made are instead useful grow your economy/base/overall score.
3. __Civilization choice__
	+ There are overall over 40 civilizations[^1] to choose from, a few have had consistently higher win rates across most elo ranges. So this section will look at whether a given civilization gives an edge (relative to others) in my own games played.[^2]
	
4. __Interaction Effects__ (if any)
	+ Finally, an interaction between _deer pushed_ and _civilization_ along with another interaction between _eapm_ and _civilization_.This binds all the aforementioned together to discern interaction effects (if any) graphically.
	
	
[^1]: This is the case if a player purchased all new Downloadable Content (DLC) which is not the case for me. Hence, newest civilizations such as Poles and Bohemians are not present in the data we go over here.
